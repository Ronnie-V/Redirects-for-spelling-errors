Script to identify redirects for spelling errors

Licensed: CC-BY-SA-4.0

This script is ment for the Dutch Wikipedia, but should be easily adapted for another Wikipedia.

The script runs through the pages in an indicated category (Wikipedia:Redirect voor spelfout), checks for all items if there are pages in the main namespace that use these missspelling and generates a page with all the pages, orded by the spelling error. The script also indicates a possible value from 'R Spelfout', giving a hint for the people who want to solve these errors.
